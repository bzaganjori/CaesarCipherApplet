# CaesarCipherApplet

This small java applet was created in my spare time. There is a runnable .jar file in the "src" where the actual 
folder containing the code can be found. When the applet is opened, the user will see an input and output box, 
choice between encrypt and decrypt, and three buttons.

To use the applet, the user must enter a message into the input text box, select if they want to encrypt or decrypt, 
set the key value (the letter shift), then press "Go". This will fill the output text field with the encrypted/decrypted 
message. The user can use keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C or the provided copy button to copy the contents of the output text field.
